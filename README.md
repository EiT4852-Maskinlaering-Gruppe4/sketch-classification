## Download sketch data to local
Download sketches [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap). Download *cat*, *dog*, *flower*, *house* and *sun*. They are all *.npy* files. Save the *.npy* files in your local repository directory under a folder named *sketches*. Do not try to push these files to github, it won't work. However, *.gitignore* will prevent this from happening.
